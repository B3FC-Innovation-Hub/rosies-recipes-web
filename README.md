# rosis-recipes
This repo contains the "working" parts of a simple recipe website which is hosted on Google Cloud Platform using buckets. 

The website will let users filter recipes based on tags like #side #meat #asian etc. and then select which recipes to include in a meal (which is handled by frontend state).
